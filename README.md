# collaborative-based-php

The script serves as the foundational understanding for developing a PHP-based film recommendation system, utilizing content from https://filmindonesia.or.id/ as a reference. The system employs two primary algorithms:

1. Content-based cosine similarity: Recommends 5 other films based on the similarity of their synopses to the film the user has watched.
2. Collaborative filtering: Recommends films to a user by gathering ratings from other users, then comparing the user's film preferences to determine similarities, resulting in recommendations that align with the preferences of other similar users.
